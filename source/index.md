# Introduction

This is a living document. Please help us improving this documentation by forking
and opening pull requests on [Github](https://github.com/developermail/slate) Thanks!

Please note that Developermail is currently in BETA. Not all features are deployed yet.
You might also expect some bugs and glitches, even though we're pretty confident to provide a stable
service nontheless, as the underlying techologies are battle-proven open-source products.

If you encounter any bugs or security issues,, please [contact us](mailto:support@developermail.io).


# Getting started

## Requirements

* Invitation code (Developermail is invite-only at the moment)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* Email client (IMAP/SMTP capable)

## Sign up

Open [https://developermail.io/signup](https://developermail.io/signup), enter your invitation code and
create your first mailbox. You are able to create more mailboxes/ aliases later.

Make sure you note your password once your signup is complete! It won't be displayed again. This
password is used to authenticate yourself at the IMAP/SMTP services as well as for Git
configuration.

We are starting by offering a 5 USD per mailbox per month plan.
This plan includes 5GB of storage.
Aliases for @developermail.io mailboxes are limited to three. Custom domains include unlimited free
aliases.


## Update DNS settings

If you registered your mailbox using the @developermail.io domain, you can skip this step.

When using a custom domain, you need to update your DNS settings in order to retrieve mails.

We're providing a DNS settings check page ``https://developermail.io/dns-check#/your-domain.com`` to
help you with these settings.


## Start configuring ...

> Clone your private developermail configuration repository

```shell
$ git clone https://developermail.io/git/bob@example.com
Cloning into 'bob@example.com'...
Username for 'https://developermail.io': bob@example.com
Password for 'https://bob@example.com@developermail.io': *********

remote: Counting objects: 11, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Total 11 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (11/11), done.
Checking connectivity... done.

$ cd bob@example.com
$ tree
.
├── config.yaml
└── sieve
    └── default.sieve

1 directory, 2 files
```

You are now ready to start configuring.


# Configuration

> Your initial ``config.yaml`` will look like this:

```yaml
# We registered at Developermail using bob@example.com
example.com:
  bob:
    sieve: sieve/default.sieve
    aliases: []
    forwards: []
```

> Or like this, if you chose to signup for a @developermail.io mailbox

```yaml
# We registered bob@developermail.io
bob@developermail.io:
  bob:
    sieve: sieve/default.sieve
    aliases: []
    forwards: []
```


## Aliases

> Create and delete aliases

```yaml
aliases:
  - alias1
  - alias2
  - ...
```

You are able to create and delete aliases by simply adding and removing them
to/ from the ``aliases`` variable.

Please note that there is a limit of 3 aliases if you use our developermail.io domain.
If you use a custom domain, there is no limit on the number of aliases.


## Forwards

> Create and delete forwards

```yaml
forwards:
  - forward1
  - forward2
  - ...
```

You are able to create and delete forwards by simply adding and removing them
to/ from the ``forwards`` variable.

There are no limits on forwards neither for developermail.io nor for custom domains.


## Mailboxes

> Create and delete mailboxes

```yaml
developermail.io:
  fritz:
    sieve: sieve/default.sieve
    aliases: []
  hans:
    aliases:
      - hansi
```

You are able to create and delete mailboxes by simply adding and removing them
to/ from the ``domain`` section.

Please note that your credit card will be charged automatically.

### Update password for mailbox

Passwords are automatically generated by our system. If you want to update
the mailbox password, you need to initiate a ``curl`` request.

> Update mailbox password

```shell
curl -X POST -u fritz@developermail.io https://developermail.io/api/accounts/change-password
```



## Domains

> Create and delete domains

```yaml
developermail.io:
  fritz:
    sieve: sieve/default.sieve
    aliases: []

custom-domain.com:
  frith:
    sieve: sieve/default.sieve
    aliases: []
```

You are able to create and delete domains by simply adding and removing them
to/ from the global section.

There are not limits on domains. We won't charge for domains neither.


## Sieve

> Your initial ``default.sieve`` will look like this:

```c
require "fileinto";
require "regex";
require "imap4flags";

# Place all spam mails in "Spam" folder
if allof (header :regex "X-DSPAM-Result" "^(Spam|Virus|Bl[ao]cklisted)$",
  not header :contains "X-DSPAM-Reclassified" "Innocent") {

  # Uncomment this if you want your spam mails to be automatically marked as read
  # setflag "\\Seen";

  fileinto "Spam";
  stop;
}
```

You can use Sieve for mail filterung rules that are applied directly on our servers.
